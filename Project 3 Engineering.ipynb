    "**Top row:** This is the route designation. The first three spaces carry the numerical portion of the route designation (one to three digits) and the last space carries the alphabetic suffix, if any. If the route number is only one digit, this digit is placed in the third space from the left; a two-digit number starts in the second space. Thus the numerals are always adjacent to the alphabetic suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The route designation given on markers is often different from the actual touring or reference route number. Sometimes a route has been absorbed by another route, or has been relocated on a new alignment and a new route designtaion placed on the old alignment. Also, a touring route may have been decommissioned and parts of it reassigned as reference routes. In many of these cases, reference markers show the older route numbers because the markers are usually only replaced as part of a major maintenance or construction project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middle row:** The first digit gives the Region number. NYSDOT divides the State into 11 Regions, which are jurisdictional divisions. For Regions 1 through 9, the appropriate numeral is used. For Region 10, the numeral 0 is used, and for Region 11 the letter X is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second digit is the county code. The counties are arranged alphabetically within their respective Regions and assigned numbers according to this listing. The first two digits combined therefore give a unique code to each of the 62 counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and fourth digits give the county order number. This number begins with 01 at the south or west terminus of the route and increases by one each time a county line is crossed. If a route enters and leaves a county more than once, each crossing is counted. [In Region 11 (New York City), this number is expressed only by the last digit in the middle row. The third digit will then be M for mainlines and C for collector-distributor roads.]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom row:** The first digit is the control segment number. A control segment is a division of a route within a county, and is almost always measured by city lines. At each county line, the control segment number is reset to 1 and increases with each city line crossing (again, repeated crossings are counted separately). In the case of the three cities (Saratoga Springs, Rome and Oneida) that have high and low tax boundaries, the control segment theoretically changes only at the low tax (outer) boundary. On existing markers, however, this digit changes only at the high tax (inner) boundary."

In fact, of all the weather-related crashes, only 17 percent happen while it is snowing or sleeting, 12 percent occur on icy pavement, and 14 percent take place on snowy or slushy pavement.
